This is most of my WIP javascript tests/projects. CSS Framework = TailwindCSS

Tutorial to import TailwindCSS to my project =

- Clone the git file
- Open VSCODE with my file
- Open a vscode terminal
- Type "npm init -y" to initialize the package.json that will help execute the script to build TAILWINDCSS everytime you use advanced customization
- Type "npm install tailwindcss" if you want the build script to work (that will install all tailwindcss node modules)

That should be it! If you want to run the build script after some customizations in the tailwind.config.js (that you can get by typing "npx tailwind init" in the terminal) or @apply customs in src/style.css stylesheet, then type "npm run build:css"
